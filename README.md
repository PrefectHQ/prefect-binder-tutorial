Welcome to our Prefect tutorials, curated for use in the interactive remote environment of BinderHub. You could even run these tutorials from your phone!!

This is a growing collection of tutorial tracks, depending on how deep you want to go into the Prefect internals.

If you are a **new user** of Prefect, start at the beginning with our interactive [Getting Started Tutorial](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PrefectHQ/prefect-binder-tutorial/master?urlpath=lab/tree/getting-started/.gitkeep).

If you want to see some more advanced Prefect pipelining features, check out our collection of [Advanced Tutorials on Prefect Core](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PrefectHQ/prefect-binder-tutorial/master/tree/advanced-tutorials/.gitkeep) or study our [Examples Directory](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PrefectHQ/prefect-binder-tutorial/master?urlpath=lab/tree/examples/.gitkeep) reformatted into interactive Jupyter Notebooks.

If you want to get into the nitty gritty of the anatomy of Prefect to become a superuser or because you want to create your own custom implementations, we have a curated [Deep Concepts](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PrefectHQ/prefect-binder-tutorial/master/tree/deep-concepts/.gitkeep) track breaking down the anatomy of the most important Prefect interfaces.

Finally, for those of you experimenting with Prefect Server as an orchestration layer, we have a growing collection of [Prefect Server Tutorials](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PrefectHQ/prefect-binder-tutorial/master?urlpath=lab/tree/prefect-server/.gitkeep) dedicated to explaining the different services in Prefect Server.
